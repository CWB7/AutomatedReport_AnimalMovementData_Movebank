## Secretarybird Project Background

BirdLife South Africaâ€™s Secretarybird Project started in 2011, with the initial main aim of obtaining movement data for immature and adult birds. The first phase of the project, to fit tracking devices to juvenile birds, was successfully completed (2012-2015) and the first analyses from these data have been written as a scientific article for submission in early July 2018 to Ostrich-Journal of African Ornithology.

The second phase of this study investigates the habitat requirements of Secretarybirds and differences in birds foraging in different habitats. To enable these additional analysis additional Secretarybirds have been added to the tracking study. Additionally, there are future plans to investigate the future effects of Climate Change on this species.

The information garnered from this tracking study contribute to the main aim of the Secretarybird Project which is to identify and implement priority conservation actions for Secretarybirds and larger ecosystems. Effective conservation necessitates actions that are based on scientific evidence and research is thus an important component of this project.

BirdLife South Africa recognizes the potential to use Secretarybirds as a flagship species to promote an interest in conservation and the correct land management practices required to benefit other bird of prey species, as well as a suite of threatened, endemic and common bird species.


This document gives a basic overview of the movements of Secretarybirds tracked by BirdLife South Africa as part of their ongoing movement ecology study, up until the date: `r format(Sys.time(), '%Y/%m/%d')`. Please note that all distance measurements are the straight line distance calculated between points and are likely and underestimation of the distances covered by each bird given the nature of how Secretarybirds move.
